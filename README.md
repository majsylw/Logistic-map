## General info
The discrete logistic model often is cited as an archetypal example of how complex, 
chaotic behaviour can arise from very simple non-linear dynamical equations. 
The equation was popularized in a 1976 paper by the biologist Robert May, 
in part as a discrete-time demographic model analogous to the logistic equation first 
created by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst. Mathematically, the logistic map is written as

x<sub>n+1</sub>=ax<sub>n</sub>(1-x<sub>n</sub>),

where x<sub>n</sub> is a number between zero and one that represents the ratio of existing 
population to the maximum possible population. The values of interest for the parameter a 
are those in the interval [0,4].
